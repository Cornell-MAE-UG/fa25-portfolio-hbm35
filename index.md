## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Hannah Mekky, and I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am passionate about solving complex problems in manufacturing by combining technical analysis with practical creativity. My internship experiences taught me how to diagnose machinery issues, streamline assembly processes, and design improvements that enhance efficiency and reliability. What excites me most is the opportunity to apply engineering not just to optimize systems, but to create solutions that benefit people and communities — whether by improving workplace safety, reducing waste, or advancing sustainable practices that make manufacturing more resilient and responsible.

Collaboration and leadership have been at the heart of my journey. From coordinating engineering projects to leading teams in athletics and the arts, I’ve learned how to bring diverse groups together to achieve shared goals. I believe the strongest solutions emerge when technical expertise is paired with empathy and a commitment to sustainability. My immediate goal is to contribute to manufacturing engineering teams where problem‑solving, collaboration, and community impact drive innovation. Long‑term, I aspire to bridge engineering and business leadership through an MBA, ensuring that the work I do continues to advance both organizational success and broader societal well‑being.
